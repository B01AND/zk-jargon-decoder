# Foreword

This "ZK Jargon Decoder" serves as a simplified dictionary for common jargon found in the zero-knowledge literature. It is collection of informal and practical definitions. Each term should have a one-liner for quick reference and a more detailed explanation.

The nature of this project implies that our definitions will not be perfectly accurate: some technical details will be omitted, some subtleties will be ignored. However if you feel that any of these definitions overlook important aspects of the terms they clarify please do get in touch here: [nico@geometrydao.xyz](mailto:nico@geometrydao.xyz).
